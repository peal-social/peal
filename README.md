## What's Peal?

Peal is the social media scheduler for teams, agents and the apps you build:
write a post once, schedule it across platforms, and see how it performs.

- **Write once, fit everywhere.** One editor, with its own text on the
  channels that need it, counters for each platform's limits, threads,
  images, videos, PDF documents and alt text.
- **Publish safely.** Each post goes out at its time, in the time zone it was
  scheduled in. When a platform does not confirm a post, Peal checks only in
  ways that cannot post it twice, and asks you before trying again.
- **Work as a team.** Workspaces with roles, review links for people outside
  them, approvals before posts go out, tags, signatures and channel sets.
- **See what worked.** Likes, reposts, replies, impressions and followers,
  read back from each platform, by channel and day, with an export, and the
  comments under your posts in one inbox.
- **Built to be built on.** A typed HTTP API, SDKs in eight languages, a
  command line, an MCP endpoint and an agent skill, and signed webhooks.
- **Yours to run.** Self-host it with Postgres and any S3-compatible store.
  Billing, captcha, AI and telemetry stay off until you configure them.
- **Or let us run it.** Peal Cloud is priced per connected account, by the
  day, with your first accounts free and members, workspaces and posts
  unlimited: see the [pricing page](https://peal.social/pricing/).

| WordPress sites (articles) |    ✓    |                     |       |

A WordPress site takes articles, with a formatted body, a featured image,
tags and categories ([Websites and articles](https://docs.peal.social/guides/channels/websites)).
Each platform's limits, media rules and the counts it gives are in the docs'
[Channels](https://docs.peal.social/guides/channels) and
[Analytics](https://docs.peal.social/guides/engage/analytics) pages. Meta ad accounts can be
connected to compare organic and paid results, and to boost a post within a
ceiling an owner sets ([Ads](https://docs.peal.social/guides/engage/ads)).

```ts
import { PealClient } from "peal-sdk";

const peal = new PealClient({ token: process.env.PEAL_API_KEY });
const me = await peal.session.me();
```

AI agents work in a workspace through the
[MCP endpoint](https://docs.peal.social/developers/mcp), the
[`peal` command line](https://docs.peal.social/developers/cli) or the
[agent skill](packages/peal-skills/skills/peal/SKILL.md), drafting posts for a person to review or
publishing them, as the workspace allows.

## Self-hosting

Peal runs anywhere Docker does. You need:

- a server with Docker Engine 28 and Compose 2.35 or later, and a domain
  pointing at it;
- Postgres (included in the stack) and an S3-compatible store;
- a way to send email: SMTP or Resend.

Billing, captcha, the writing assistant, ads and telemetry stay off until you
configure them, so nothing is limited and nothing leaves your server.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/peal-social/peal.git && cd peal/packages/peal-docker
mkdir -p /srv/peal && cp self-host.env.example /srv/peal/peal.env   # then fill it in
docker compose --project-name peal --file compose.production.yaml \
  --file compose.self-host.yaml --env-file /srv/peal/peal.env up --build --detach --wait
```

Caddy then serves Peal on your domain, with a Let's Encrypt certificate. The
[self-hosting guide](https://docs.peal.social/self-hosting) explains each
service and how to connect each platform, and
[environment variables](https://docs.peal.social/self-hosting/environment-variables) lists
every setting.

## Licensing

Peal's licensor is Peal. Each part of the repository is under one of two
licences:

| Part                                                         | Licence                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Everything, unless a folder below has a `LICENSE` of its own | [FSL-1.1-ALv2](LICENSE.md): any use but a competing service, and Apache-2.0 two years after each release |
| [`peal-contract`](packages/peal-contract), the API contract  | [Apache-2.0](packages/peal-contract/LICENSE)                                                             |
| [`peal-sdk`](packages/peal-sdk), the SDKs                    | [Apache-2.0](packages/peal-sdk/LICENSE)                                                                  |
| [`peal-skills`](packages/peal-skills), the agent skill       | [Apache-2.0](packages/peal-skills/LICENSE)                                                               |

Peal is fair source, not open source: you may use, modify and self-host it for
anything but offering it to others as a competing service, and each release
becomes Apache-2.0 two years after it ships. The SDKs are generated from the
contract's OpenAPI document, so the contract is Apache-2.0 with them: what an
SDK user installs, and the API description it comes from, carry no FSL terms.
Each `package.json` says which licence applies, and each Apache-2.0 package
has a `NOTICE` naming Peal as its copyright holder.
