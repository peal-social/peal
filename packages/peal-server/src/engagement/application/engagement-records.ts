 * in the caller's transaction, and records the workspace as erased, so a
 * collection run that listed its posts before follows none of them after.
 * A user's export holds the replies they wrote, never the comments they
 * answered, which are other people's; and the same for the reviews of
 * locations, which go with their workspace and, at once, with their
 * channel, and for direct messages: a channel's conversations go at once
