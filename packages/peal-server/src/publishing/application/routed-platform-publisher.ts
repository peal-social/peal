 * Before a post goes out, the workspace's plan must have room for it now,
 * not only when it was scheduled, as a trial or a larger plan may have
 * ended since: a workspace with more channels or members than its plan
 * allows sends nothing, and of the posts due in a month only the first its plan allows
 * go out, by their time. The others fail as `planLimit`, nothing sent. A
 * run resumed may have gone out already, and is checked no further; nor is
 * a part after the first, whose post is already out. Every part sent to a
 * platform that bills per post (X) is claimed on the billing account's
 * meter first (`PostMeter`): refused, nothing is sent (`paymentMethodRequired`,
 * `xCeilingReached`); refused by the platform, it is given back. A part
