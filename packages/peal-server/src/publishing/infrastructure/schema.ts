/**
 * A post and where it is in its life. A scheduled post keeps its instant in
 * UTC and the IANA zone it was chosen in. `schedule_revision` goes up with
 * every schedule and every move back to draft: the job started for a
 * revision (`execution_id`) only publishes while the post still has it.
 *
 * Its content: `text`, the `media` it shows in order (media ids with their
 * alt text) and `text_overrides`, the text it has instead on some channels,
 * each with the media it shows there instead when it gives some (`media`,
 * left out otherwise).
 * That is its first part; `follow_ups` holds the parts after it, in order,
 * as the domain's `PostPart` encodes them (text, media, text overrides and
 * the seconds each waits), empty on a post of one part, as every post from
 * before parts is. `poll` is the poll asked with the first part, as the
 * domain's `Poll` encodes it (its choices, minutes open, whether several
 * may be picked), null on a post without one, as on every post from
 * before polls.
 * `author_id` is the member who created it (a Better Auth user id), null
 * when an API key did, or for posts from before authors were kept.
 *
 * `created_via` and `scheduled_via` say how its creator, and whoever last
 * scheduled or moved it, reached Peal (the web app, an API key, an OAuth
 * application, with the key's or the application's id and name: JSON the
 * domain's `PostOriginSchema` decodes), and `scheduled_by` which member
 * scheduled it. All null on posts from before they were kept, the last two
 * on a draft too, and `scheduled_by` when an API key scheduled it.
 *
 * `tag_ids` are the tags (`tags`) its workspace filed it under, each once:
 * no part of what it says, and written apart from its status
 * (`PostRepository.setTags`), so a job that settles the post never undoes
 * a tagging made meanwhile.
 *
 * `queue_id` is the queue (`queues`) that gave it its time, null for a
 * time chosen by hand: the post holds that queue's slot while it is
 * scheduled, awaiting approval or publishing at exactly the slot's
 * instant, which is all a slot's being taken is. No foreign key, as
 * elsewhere here: deleting a queue clears the column in its transaction.
 *
 * `recycling_id` and `occurrence` say which recycling rule
 * (`recycling_rules`) made the post, and its place among the rule's posts,
 * from 2; null on any other post. Their unique index is what makes an
 * occurrence once, whoever runs the rule.
