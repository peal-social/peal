 * instance restricted: either, with Mastodon's JSON error, is a refused
 * token, which only reconnecting fixes on Mastodon; without it, something
 * on the way refused the call before the instance saw it, and the instance
 * may answer later. 413 and 422 refuse the file or the post as sent; 429 is
 * the rate limit, whose reset time the instance gives in X-RateLimit-Reset.
 * A server error on the post itself leaves its fate unknown; on anything
 * else, it is the instance being down. A 408 is read as one: the request
 * timed out on the way, whatever it carried. Error messages are not kept, as they
 * may quote the post.
