/**
 * One entity per channel (its id is the channel id), which makes every call
 * to the channel's platform account, one at a time: handlers run in turn, so
 * two posts due at once on one account go out one after the other, and a
 * later token refresh or rate-limit check never races a publish.
 *
 * Calls are volatile: nothing about them is stored in the cluster tables, so
 * post content never lands there. The job calling through the gate is
 * durable, and the publication journal covers a call cut short.
 *
 * A publish runs whole inside its gate: the media uploads, the wait while
 * the platform processes them, the token renewed on demand, the post and its
 * confirmation. `Resume` checks a call an earlier run left in flight.
 * `ReadMetrics` reads the counts of some of the channel's posts for
 * analytics, so reads take turns with publishing and share its rate limits;
 * each is bounded in time.
 * `ReadAccount` reads the account's own numbers the same way, once a day.
 * `ReadComments` reads the comments under some of its posts the same way,
 * and `SendReply`, `ResumeReply`, `WithdrawReply` and `ModerateComment` act
 * on them as the account, for engagement: their payloads are ids, and the
 * text of a reply stays in engagement's tables. `ReadReviews` reads a
 * location's reviews, and `SendReviewReply`, `ResumeReviewReply` and
 * `WithdrawReviewReply` answer them, the same way, and `ReadMessages`,
 * `SendMessage` and `ResumeMessage` read a channel's direct messages and
 * answer them: their payloads are ids, and no message's text travels
 * through the cluster's tables. `RemoveLivePost` deletes a
 * post, or a part of one, that a member asked to unpublish, by the
 * platform's id for it: a removal never overlaps a publish on the channel.
 * `EditLivePost` replaces the text of a part a member asked to edit, by
 * the change's id and the platform's: the text never passes through the
 * gate, whose side reads it from the change.
 *
 * Calls run in the order they came, whichever context sent them. Each
 * collection (post counts, the account, comments, reviews, messages) has one call a channel
 * outstanding at most, so a publish waits for the reads that came before
 * it: one of each at most, each bounded, never for those after. Their
 * crons start on minutes of their own (`test/app/cron-schedules.test.ts`).
