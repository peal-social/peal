    /// Starts a rule on the comments of a post that went out (`postId`) or of every post of a channel (`channelId`), exactly one of them, with 1 to 10 `keywords` and a `reply`. A rule answers, by itself and in public, as the channel's account, a comment received after it started or was last set going again, under a post it answers on (a post's rule acts on the channels the post is for, scheduled or out), that holds one of its keywords as a word (whatever its case and accents): with its `reply`, once a comment and once a person, 25 replies a day at most, and 100 a day for every rule of a channel together, through the inbox's own replies (their journal, one reply a comment, each one of the billing account's outbound messages). It answers on Mastodon, and on Facebook Pages and Instagram where the server reads their comments; Bluesky's, X's, LinkedIn's and YouTube's rules forbid an app to answer by itself, and `channels` says so. It never likes, follows or messages anyone privately. It acts as whoever started it, with what they may do then: it ends when they can no longer answer comments, and when its channel is disconnected. It is refused when no channel it answers on can carry its reply (CommentRuleNotPossible, with each channel's reason). A workspace keeps 100 rules active or paused. Needs engagement:reply; never staff acting as a member.
